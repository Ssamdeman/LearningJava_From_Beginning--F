Discuss your experiences in writing these programs. What development tools (IDE, etc.) did you
use? Did you develop on cs.umb.edu servers, or if on your own PC/Mac did you have any problem
recompiling and running on Linux?
I used IntelliJ IDE. I did not use any cs.emb.edu servers. I did not run any many issues because I had Mac that already runs thew Linux environment. Although I had hard time to get the testing the code it self. And the package system was confusing. I know we had complete directions but still it took a while to figure out on what to do. Another thing I would add that the testing files did not help at all. It was too confuse to even run any tests. It was, of course, learning experience in fully building project. Maybe it us just first time.

2. Analyze the worst case big-O CPU performance of LineReport, for N input lines; and O(N) different
users, and thus max O(N) entries on each list once partially done. To make it easier, try to first figure
out what is the run time for each separate line.
K = Constant 
N = variable 
LineReport()  = k
LoadDataI() --> addObsevation() which has O(n). So the worth case would be 0(n).
generateReport() ---> findMax() which has worse case O(n) which makes 2*500*O(n)
The worse cause scenario for T(N) = O(n); ignoring the constant.
The max (all the factions) 0(n);


3. Show the command line compile and run using commands as shown above, and display of directories
by the Windows tree command or Linux/Mac du command

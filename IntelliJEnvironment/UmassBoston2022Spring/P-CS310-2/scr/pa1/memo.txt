1. How many ms did every table take when testing on tale.txt?
ST --->  134 ms
SeparateChainingHashST---> 137 ms
LinearProbingHashST---> 33698 ms
SequentialSearchST--->  23 ms

2.Does it (approximately) correspond to the expected insert and search performance for each table? No
need to perform a detailed analysis, but please mention what you know about the expected runtime
for each one of the lookup table types.
    ST--> The look runtime is guarantee O(Log(N))
    SeparateChainingHashST---> 0(N)
    LinearProbingHashST--->  0(N)
    SequentialSearchST---> 0(N)
This results make sense since the HsTables avaragetly should run on 0(n).
